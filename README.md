### About

I am an associate professor of engineering at Harvey Mudd College. My background is in experimental fluid mechanics, including extensive experience in 2D and 3D particle image velocimetry. I'm broadly interested in developing tools to address flow measurement challenges (e.g., swimming organisms, measurements around bodies, surfaces, and interfaces) and in low-cost PIV systems.

### Research Group
I direct @Flow-Imaging-Lab-at-Mudd. Our repositories include tools for quantitative analysis of 3D PIV measurements of vortical wakes, synthetic particle image generation for multicamera PIV, and the openfv library for synthetic aperture refocusing and particle image velocimetry (SAPIV).
